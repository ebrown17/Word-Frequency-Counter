Word-Frequency-Counter
======================

Recursively searches through a specified directory and lists the count off all unique words used.(Must only be txt files)

One of my side projects during my internship that I did for fun.

Must give program a directory when you run it. Then the program will search through the listed directory, plus all 
subdirectories. Returns a list of all words and the count of how often each word was used.

Only tested with directories containing text files since that was the only thing i needed to worry about when I wrote this.
